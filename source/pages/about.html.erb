        <p class="lead">
          The goal of the Alpheios project is to help people learn how to learn languages as efficiently and enjoyably as possible,
          and in a way that best helps them understand their own literary heritage and culture, and the literary heritage and culture
          of other peoples throughout history.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Our initial focus will be on classical literature in languages no longer spoken, such as Latin and ancient Greek. The influence of these classics,
          like the river Alpheios, still runs like a subterranean stream deep beneath the contemporary world, as artists and thinkers continue to draw inspiration from them.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Next priorities include supporting more languages, including Persian, Syriac and Hebrew, and adding audio and imagery as
          well as language learning aids and games.  Longer term goals include using the Alpheios platform to collect big data on
          how different individuals can best learn the historical languages (those without living native speakers) and appreciate their classical literature, and
          how this data can be interpreted neurophysiologically to shed light on human literacy and response to literature in general.
