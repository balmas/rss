        <p class="lead">
          This release of the Alpheios Reading Tools for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/alpheios-reading-tools/apkmkeppocbbebomnhdmhfenfifkhjfd">Chrome</a>
          and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/alpheios-reading-tools/">Firefox</a> is an <b>alpha</b> version, released with these goals in mind:</p>
          <ul class="lead">
            <li>To provide a replacement for the original Firefox extensions.</li>

          like to see added or improved. Below are lists of the <a href="#features">basic functionality</a> which should be working now,

        <h3>Known Issues and Requests for Feedback</h3>
        <p class="lead">
          <ul class="lead">
            <li>Dynamic positioning of the popup near the word selection may not be optimal on all screen resolutions, particularly on words
              which are near the edge of the display. You can choose to set the position to fixed in the Options panel as a fallback.</li>
            <li>We are actively seeking input on the best new user interface design for Alpheios. The current design is provisional
              and we expect we may change it significantly in coming releases.  We need feedback from users to know what would work best.</li>
            <li>The Latin inflection tables are missing irregular verbs and the ability to browse the tables independent from word lookups.</li>
            <li>The Greek and Latin grammar displays need better navigation support and an updated design.</li>
            <li>Automatic identification of the language of a page only works if the language has been explicitly identified in the markup. This should be improved upon.</li>
            <li>The Persian functionality is only experimental. We need a new morphological analyzer in order to provide more complete results.</li>

        <h3>Longer term Roadmap</h3>
        <p class="lead">
          We have big dreams for Alpheios. We list just some of those here. Eventually we hope to support many additional features (such as commentary and annotation).
          We hope to provide full multilingual support for the interface and supporting resources, and also to add reading support for  additional languages such as
          Hebrew, Syriac and Coptic. We want to offer more resources (lexicons, grammars, treebanks, translations, etc.) for the existing languages, and to allow users to supply and share their own resources for specific languages and texts. We want to link to the
          amazing array of already existing-community provided tools and services for these lanaguages, and to allow users the ability to customize the
          interface and resources for language learning according to their own needs and preferences. We will provide mobile applications and
          learning games to accompany the browser extensions. We will also explore the addition of audio and visual aids to accompany the texts.
